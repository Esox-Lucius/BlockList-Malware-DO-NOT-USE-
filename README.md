- I use these lists on my Pi-Hole® - to play around with! 

- The lists have only been tested/used with the Pi-Hole® software.

- I do not work for, or have anything to do with, nor am I affiliated with **otx.alienvault.com** OR **Pi-Hole®** in any way. I only use their service & software.

## What is otx.alienvault.com?

*World's First Open Threat Intelligence Community*

*Threat sharing in the security industry remains mainly ad-hoc and informal, filled with blind spots, frustration, and pitfalls. Our vision is for companies and government agencies to gather and share relevant, timely, and accurate information about new or ongoing cyberattacks and threats as quickly as possible to avoid major breaches (or minimize the damage from an attack). The Alien Labs® Open Threat Exchange® (OTX™) delivers the first truly open threat intelligence community that makes this vision a reality.*

*How OTX Works*

*OTX provides open access to a global community of threat researchers and security professionals. It now has more than 100,000 participants in 140 countries, who contribute over 19 million threat indicators daily. It delivers community-generated threat data, enables collaborative research, and automates the process of updating your security infrastructure with threat data from any source. OTX enables anyone in the security community to actively discuss, research, validate, and share the latest threat data, trends, and techniques, strengthening your defenses while helping others do the same.*

## What is Pi-Hole?
*The Pi-hole® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.*

*Configure your router’s DHCP options to force clients to use Pi-hole as their DNS server, or manually configure each device​ to use the Pi-hole as their DNS server.*

*By pairing your Pi-hole with a VPN, you can have ad blocking on your cellular devices, helping with limited bandwidth data plans.*

*You can run Pi-hole in a container, or deploy it directly to a supported operating system via our automated installer.*

*Pi-hole is free, but powered by your donations.*

*WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.*

*At DuckDuckGo, we do not collect or share any personal information. That's our privacy policy in a nutshell. For example, we do not store IP addresses, and we do not create unique cookies. As such, we do not even have the ability to create search histories or search sessions for any individual — privacy by design.*


*To be clear, this means __we cannot ever tell what individual people are doing since everyone is anonymous__, and that is a limit of our statistical methods since we are private by design. We can, however, within this anonymous limitation, reliably determine what changes are generally working, using these anonymous methods.*

*Output of the program is as safe as possible and is by far one of the most secure encryption programs in the world. Only criteria during the development was maximum security.*

*Every single encryption or hashing algorithm was judged only based on it's quality with speed being irrelevant. Maximum emphasis was also placed on implementation and use of individual cryptographic functions and software as whole.*

*Only way to decode original content is by using correct password. Successful attack on two 4096 bit keys and 256 bit encrypted salt with using 6 respected symmetrical ciphers in safe cascade belongs to the realm of fantasy.*

*Program doesn't include any backdoors and design itself doesn't allow hiding them.*

### https://tox.chat/

*Tox began a few years ago, in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks regarding NSA spying activity. The idea was to create an instant messaging application that ran without requiring the use of central servers. The system would be distributed, peer-to-peer, and end-to-end encrypted, with no way to disable any of the encryption features; at the same time, the application would be easily usable by the layperson with no practical knowledge of cryptography or distributed systems.*

All of these were fixed promptly as they came to our attention. The security of our software is our first priority, followed by reliability, followed by performance and features.*

*Vulnerabilities specific to other SSH implementations tend to not apply to ours. Our software is developed independently and does not share code with OpenSSH and other implementations. Our SSH protocol implementation is one of the more stringent ones, on several occasions exposing flaws in other implementations.*

# Notes

My little project is not for helping you setup, configure, or troubleshoot your pihole or network setup. It is assumed that you know the basics of setting up and using pihole and related technologies associated with it, including how to add blocklists to pihole.
